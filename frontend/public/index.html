    <!-- Tailwind CSS via CDN for now, as per plan adjustment, but we also installed it via npm. 
         We can remove this later if we set up postcss correctly. For now, let's stick to the plan of migrating first. 
         Actually, the plan said "Install tailwindcss via PostCSS". So I should probably NOT include CDN if I want to do it right.
         But to ensure styles work immediately without complex setup debugging, I might keep it or try to set up main.css.
         Let's try to do it the "Vue CLI" way with postcss. -->
